// This repository contains the main project for CoE101 for Fall 2014.

This project has us program 2 songs onto an ARM Keil microcontroller to be played onto a simple speaker we built.

My songs include Go Go Power Rangers and another song that will go unnamed.

This project is implemented through C++.
